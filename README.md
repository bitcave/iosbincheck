#ioscheck

Not sure if this will be useful to anyone but this is a simple script to automate some of the checks and tasks I perform when looking at an iOS application.

Usage:

`ruby ioscheck.rb [PATH TO BINARY]`

Other Notes:

Class dump uses class-dump-z which needs to be your PATH for it to work.
